# Annoy

WIP: Webapp that allows the user to create tasks and set reminders. The fun part is the reminder can either be an SMS or an automated phone call to any number. So you can use it to text/call yourself or anyone else at a scheduled time. But ofcourse you can also use it to bother your friends with meaningless texts and automated prank calls. Or if you have a gentle heart, you can use it to wake someone up with your favourite poem or song. Have fun with it!

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different 
IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).
